A simple React app for visualizing baby-friendly spots in Toronto.

## Development

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

To run the full stack app locally, you can install the [Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) and run `netlify dev`.

You will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory, and set an `API_KEY` environemnt variable with a [Google API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) configured for access to Google Sheets.
